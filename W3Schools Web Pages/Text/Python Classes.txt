     Python Classes and Objects 
      
      ? Previous

     Python Classes/Objects 
     Python is an object oriented programming language. 
     Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. 
     A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. 
      
     Create a Class 
     To create a class, use the keyword class: 
      
      Example 
      Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x: 
      
        class MyClass:
         x = 5
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     Create Object 
     Now we can use the class named myClass to create objects: 
      
      Example 
      Create an object named p1, and print the value of x: 
      
        p1 = MyClass()
       print(p1.x)
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     The __init__() Function 
     The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications. 
     To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function. 
     All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated. 
     Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created: 
      
      Example 
      Create a class named Person, use the __init__() function to assign values for name and age: 
      
        class Person:
         def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age
       
       p1 = Person("John", 36)
        
       print(p1.name)
       print(p1.age)
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
      Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object. 
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     Object Methods 
     Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object. 
     Let us create a method in the Person class: 
      
      Example 
      Insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object: 
      
        class Person:
         def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age
       
         def myfunc(self):
           print("Hello my name is " + self.name)
       
       p1 = Person("John", 36)
       p1.myfunc()
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
      Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class. 
      
      
     The self Parameter 
     The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class. 
     It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class: 
      
      Example 
      Use the words mysillyobject and abc instead of self: 
      
        class Person:
         def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
           mysillyobject.name = name
           mysillyobject.age = age
       
         def myfunc(abc):
           print("Hello my name is " + abc.name)
       
       p1 = Person("John", 36)
       p1.myfunc()
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     Modify Object Properties 
     You can modify properties on objects like this: 
      
      Example 
      Set the age of p1 to 40: 
      
        p1.age = 40
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     Delete Object Properties 
     You can delete properties on objects by using the  del keyword: 
      
      Example 
      Delete the age property from the p1 object: 
      
        del p1.age
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     Delete Objects 
     You can delete objects by using the del keyword: 
      
      Example 
      Delete the p1 object: 
      
        del p1
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     The pass Statement 
     class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error. 
      
      Example 
      
        class Person:
         pass
       
      Run example ?
