      SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. 
      SVG defines vector-based graphics in XML format. 
      
      
     Examples in Each Chapter 
     With our "Try it Yourself" editor, you can edit the SVG, and click on a button to view the result. 
      
      SVG Example 
      
        <html>
        <body>
        
        <h1>My first SVG</h1>
        
        <svg width="100" height="100">
         <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
       </svg>
        
        </body>
        </html> 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     What you should already know 
     Before you continue, you should have some basic understanding of the following: 
      
      HTML  
      Basic XML 
      
     If you want to study these subjects first, find the tutorials on our Home page. 
      
     What is SVG? 
      
      SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics 
      SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web 
      SVG defines the graphics in XML format 
      Every element and every attribute in SVG files can be animated 
      SVG is a W3C recommendation 
      SVG integrates with other W3C standards such as the DOM and XSL 
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     SVG is a W3C Recommendation 
     SVG 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation on 4 September 2001. 
     SVG 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation on 14 January 2003. 
     SVG 1.1 (Second Edition) became a W3C Recommendation on 16 August 2011. 
      
     SVG Advantages 
     Advantages of using SVG over other image formats (like JPEG and GIF) are: 
      
      SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor 
      SVG images can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed 
      SVG images are scalable 
      SVG images can be printed with high quality at any resolution 
      SVG images are zoomable 
      SVG graphics do NOT lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized 
      SVG is an open standard 
      SVG files are pure XML 
      
     The main competitor to SVG is Flash. 
     The biggest advantage SVG has over Flash is the compliance with other standards (e.g. XSL and the DOM). Flash relies on proprietary technology that is not open source. 
      
     Creating SVG Images 
     SVG images can be created with any text editor, but it is often more convenient to create SVG images with a drawing program, like Inkscape.
