     HTML Responsive Web Design

     What is Responsive Web Design? 
     Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones): 
      Try it Yourself ?  
      
      Note: A web page should look good on any device! 
      
      
     Setting The Viewport 
     When making responsive web pages, add the following <meta> element in all your web pages: 
      
      Example 
      
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. 
     Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag: 
      
      
        Without the viewport meta tag:
        
        
       
      
        With the viewport meta tag:
        
        
       
      
      
      Tip: If you are browsing this page on a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links above to see the difference. 
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     Responsive Images 
     Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size. 
     Using the width Property 
     If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down: 
      
      
      Example 
      
        <img src="img_girl.jpg" 
       style="width:100%;"> 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead. 
     Using the max-width Property 
     If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size: 
      
      
      Example 
      
        <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="
       max-width:100%;height:auto;"> 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     Show Different Images Depending on Browser Width 
     The HTML <picture> element allows you to define different images for different browser window sizes. 
     Resize the browser window to see how the image below change depending on the width: 
      
       
       
       
       
      
      
      Example 
      
        <picture>
         <source srcset="img_smallflower.jpg" media="(max-width: 600px)">
         <source srcset="img_flowers.jpg" media="(max-width: 1500px)">
         <source srcset="flowers.jpg">
         <img src="img_smallflower.jpg" alt="Flowers">
       </picture>
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     Responsive Text Size 
     The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width". 
     That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window: 
      
      Hello World 
      Resize the browser window to see how the text size scales. 
      
      
      Example 
      
        <h1 style="
       font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1> 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
      Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm. 
      
      
     Media Queries 
     In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries in responsive web pages. 
     With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes. 
     Example: resize the browser window to see that the three div elements below will display horizontally on large screens and stacked vertically on small screens: 
      
      
       
       
        Left Menu
        
        
        
        
       
       
       
        Main Content
        
        
        
        
       
       
       
        Right Content
        
        
        
        
       
      
      
      Example 
      
        <style>
       .left, .right {
         float: left;
         width: 20%; /* The width is 20%, by default */
       }
       
       .main {
         float: left;
         width: 60%; /* The width is 60%, by default */
       }
       
       /* Use a media query to add a breakpoint at 800px: */
       @media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
         .left, .main, .right {
           width: 100%; /* The width is 100%, when the viewport is 800px or smaller */
         }
       }
       </style>
