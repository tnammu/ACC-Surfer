     AngularJS Data Binding

     Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view. 
      
     Data Model 
     AngularJS applications usually have a data model. The data model is a collection of data available for the application. 
      
      Example 
      
        var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
        app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
         $scope.firstname = "John";
         $scope.lastname = "Doe";
       });
       
       
      
      
     HTML View 
     The HTML container where the AngularJS application is displayed, is called the view. 
     The view has access to the model, and there are several ways of displaying model data in the view. 
     You can use the ng-bind directive, which will bind the innerHTML of the element to the specified model property: 
      
      Example 
      
        <p ng-bind="firstname"></p>
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     You can also use double braces {{ }} to display content from the model: 
      
      Example 
      
        <p>First name: {{firstname}}</p>
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     Or you can use the ng-model directive on HTML controls to bind the model to the view. 
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     The ng-model Directive 
     Use the ng-model directive to bind data from the model to the view on HTML controls (input, select, textarea) 
      
      Example 
      
        <input ng-model="firstname">
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     The ng-model directive provides a two-way binding between the model and the view. 
      
     Two-way Binding 
     Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view. 
     When data in the model changes, the view reflects the change, and when data in the view changes, the model is updated as well. This happens immediately and automatically, which makes sure that the model and the view is updated at all times. 
      
      Example 
       
       
         <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
          Name: <input ng-model="firstname">
          <h1>{{firstname}}</h1>
        </div>
        
        <script>
         
        
       
         var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
         app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
          $scope.firstname = "John";
          $scope.lastname = "Doe";
        }); 
        
       
         </script> 
        
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     AngularJS Controller 
     Applications in AngularJS are controlled by controllers. Read about controllers in the AngularJS Controllers chapter. 
     Because of the immediate synchronization of the model and the view, the controller can be completely separated from the view, and simply concentrate on the model data. Thanks to the data binding in AngularJS, the view will reflect any changes made in the controller. 
      
      Example 
       
       
         <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
          <h1 ng-click="changeName()">{{firstname}}</h1>
        </div>
        
        <script>
         
        
       
         var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
         app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
          $scope.firstname = "John";
          $scope.changeName = function() {
            $scope.firstname = "Nelly";
          }
        });
         
        
       
         </script>
