     HTTP Request Methods 
      
      ? Previous 
      Next ? 
      
      
     The two most common HTTP methods are: GET and POST. 
      
     What is HTTP? 
     The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. 
     HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. 
     A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server. 
     Example: A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content. 
      
     HTTP Methods 
      
      GET 
      POST 
      PUT 
      HEAD 
      DELETE 
      PATCH 
      OPTIONS 
      
      
     The GET Method 
     GET is used to request data from a specified resource. 
     GET is one of the most common HTTP methods.  
     Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request: 
      
      
        /test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2 
      
      
     Some other notes on GET requests: 
      
      GET requests can be cached 
      GET requests remain in the browser history 
      GET requests can be bookmarked 
      GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data 
      GET requests have length restrictions 
      GET requests are only used to request data (not modify) 
      
      
     The POST Method 
     POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. 
     The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request: 
      
      
        POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
        Host: w3schools.com
        name1=value1&name2=value2 
      
      
     POST is one of the most common HTTP methods.  
     Some other notes on POST requests: 
      
      POST requests are never cached 
      POST requests do not remain in the browser history 
      POST requests cannot be bookmarked 
      POST requests have no restrictions on data length 
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     The PUT Method 
     PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. 
     The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times. 
      
     The HEAD Method 
     HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body. 
     In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will make the same request but will not return the list of users. 
     HEAD requests are useful for checking what a GET request will return before actually making a GET request - like before downloading a large file or response body. 
      
     The DELETE Method 
     The DELETE method deletes the specified resource. 
      
     The OPTIONS Method 
     The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource. 
      
     Compare GET vs. POST 
     The following table compares the two HTTP methods: GET and POST. 
      
       
       
         
           
         GET 
         POST 
         
         
         BACK button/Reload 
         Harmless 
         Data will be re-submitted (the browser should alert the user that the data are about to be re-submitted) 
         
         
         Bookmarked 
         Can be bookmarked 
         Cannot be bookmarked 
         
         
         Cached 
         Can be cached 
         Not cached 
         
         
         Encoding type 
         application/x-www-form-urlencoded 
         application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data. Use multipart encoding for binary data 
         
         
         History 
         Parameters remain in browser history 
         Parameters are not saved in browser history 
         
         
         Restrictions on data length 
         Yes, when sending data, the GET method adds the data to the URL; and the length of a URL is limited (maximum URL length is 2048 characters) 
         No restrictions 
         
         
         Restrictions on data type 
         Only ASCII characters allowed 
         No restrictions. Binary data is also allowed 
         
         
         Security 
         GET is less secure compared to POST because data sent is part of the URL  Never use GET when sending passwords or other sensitive information! 
         POST is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs 
         
         
         Visibility 
         Data is visible to everyone in the URL 
         Data is not displayed in the URL
