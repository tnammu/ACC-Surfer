     Python For Loops 
      
      ? Previous

     Python For Loops 
     A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). 
     This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages. 
     With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc. 
      
      Example 
      Print each fruit in a fruit list: 
      
        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
       for x in fruits:
          print(x) 
       
      Run example ? 
      
     The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand. 
      
     Looping Through a String 
     Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters: 
      
      Example 
      Loop through the letters in the word "banana": 
      
        for x in "banana":
         print(x) 
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     The break Statement 
     With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items: 
      
      Example 
      Exit the loop when x is "banana": 
      
        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
       for x in fruits:
         print(x) 
         if x == "banana":
           break
        
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
      Example 
      Exit the loop when x is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print: 
      
        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
       for x in fruits:
         if x == "banana":
           break
         print(x) 
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
      
       
       
        
       
      
      
     The continue Statement 
     With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next: 
      
      Example 
      Do not print banana: 
      
        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
       for x in fruits:
         if x == "banana":
           continue
         print(x) 
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     The range() Function To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the 
     range() function,
      
     The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number. 
      
      Example 
      Using the range() function: 
      
        for x in range(6):
          print(x) 
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
      Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5. 
      
     The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6): 
      
      Example 
      Using the start parameter: 
      
        for x in range(2, 6):
          print(x) 
       
      Run example ? 
      
     The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3): 
      
      Example 
      Increment the sequence with 3 (default is 1): 
      
        for x in range(2, 30, 3):
          print(x) 
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     Else in For Loop 
     The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished: 
      
      Example 
      Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended: 
      
        for x in range(6):
         print(x)
       else:
         print("Finally finished!")
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     Nested Loops 
     A nested loop is a loop inside a loop. 
     The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop": 
      
      Example 
      Print each adjective for every fruit: 
      
        adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
       fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
        
       for x in adj:
         for y in fruits:
           print(x, y)
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     The pass Statement 
     for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error. 
      
      Example 
      
        for x in [0, 1, 2]:
         pass
       
      Run example ?
