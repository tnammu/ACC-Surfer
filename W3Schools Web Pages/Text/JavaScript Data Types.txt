     JavaScript Data Types 
     JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more: 
      
      
        var length = 16;                               // Number
        var lastName = "Johnson";                      // String
        var x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};    // Object 
       
      
      
     The Concept of Data Types 
     In programming, data types is an important concept. 
     To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type. 
     Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this: 
      
      
        var x = 16 + "Volvo";
       
      
     Does it make any sense to add "Volvo" to sixteen? Will it produce an error or will it produce a result? 
     JavaScript will treat the example above as: 
      
      
        var x = "16" + "Volvo";
       
      
      
      When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string. 
      
      
      Example 
      
        var x = 16 + "Volvo";
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
      Example 
      
        var x = "Volvo" + 16;
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results: 
      
      JavaScript: 
      
        var x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo"; 
       
      Result: 
       
       20Volvo 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
      JavaScript: 
      
        var x = "Volvo" + 16 + 4; 
       
      Result: 
       
       Volvo164 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     In the first example, JavaScript treats 16 and 4 as numbers, until it reaches "Volvo". 
     In the second example, since the first operand is a string, all operands are treated as strings. 
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     JavaScript Types are Dynamic 
     JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types: 
      
      Example 
      
        var x;           // Now x is undefined
        x = 5;           // Now x is a Number
        x = "John";      // Now x is a String 
       
      Try it yourself ? 
      
      
     JavaScript Strings 
     A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe". 
     Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:  
      
      Example 
      
        var carName1 = "Volvo XC60";   // Using double quotes
        var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';   // Using single quotes
       
      Try it yourself ? 
      
     You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string: 
      
      Example 
      
        var answer1 = "It's alright";             // Single quote inside double quotes
        var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";    // Single quotes inside double quotes
        var answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';    // Double quotes inside single quotes 
       
      Try it yourself ?
      
     You will learn more about strings later in this tutorial. 
      
     JavaScript Numbers 
     JavaScript has only one type of numbers. 
     Numbers can be written with, or without decimals: 
      
      Example 
      
        var x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals
        var x2 = 34;        // Written without decimals 
       
      Try it yourself ? 
      
     Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation: 
      
      Example 
      
        var y = 123e5;      // 12300000
        var z = 123e-5;     // 0.00123
       
      Try it yourself ?
      
     You will learn more about numbers later in this tutorial. 
      
     JavaScript Booleans 
     Booleans can only have two values: true or false. 
      
      Example 
      
        var x = 5;
       var y = 5;
       var z = 6;
       (x == y)       // Returns true
       (x == z)       // Returns false
       
      Try it Yourself ?
      
     Booleans are often used in conditional testing. 
     You will learn more about conditional testing later in this tutorial. 
      
     JavaScript Arrays 
     JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets. 
     Array items are separated by commas. 
     The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names): 
      
      Example 
      
        var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on. 
     You will learn more about arrays later in this tutorial. 
      
     JavaScript Objects 
     JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}. 
     Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas. 
      
      Example 
      
        var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
        
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     The object (person) in the example above has 4 properties: firstName, lastName, age, and eyeColor. 
     You will learn more about objects later in this tutorial. 
      
     The typeof Operator 
     You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. 
     The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression: 
      
      Example 
      
        typeof ""             // Returns "string"
        typeof "John"         // Returns "string"
        typeof "John Doe"     // Returns "string"
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
      Example 
      
        typeof 0              // Returns "number"
        typeof 314            // Returns "number"
        typeof 3.14           // Returns "number"
        typeof (3)            // Returns "number"
       typeof (3 + 4)        // Returns "number"
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     Undefined 
     In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined. 
      
      Example 
      
        var car;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined. 
      
      Example 
      
        car = undefined;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     Empty Values  
     An empty value has nothing to do with undefined. 
     An empty string has both a legal value and a type. 
      
      Example 
      
        var car = "";    // The value is "", the typeof is "string"
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     Null 
     In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist. 
     Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object. 
      
      You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null. 
      
     You can empty an object by setting it to null: 
      
      Example 
      
        var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
       person = null;    // Now value is null, but type is still an object
        
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     You can also empty an object by setting it to undefined: 
      
      Example 
      
        var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
       person = undefined;   // Now both value and type is undefined
        
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     Difference Between Undefined and Null 
     undefined and null are equal in value but different in type: 
      
      
        typeof undefined           // undefined
       typeof null                // object
       
       null === undefined         // false
       null == undefined          // true
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     Primitive Data 
     A primitive data value is a single simple data value with no additional properties and methods. 
     The typeof operator can return one of these primitive types: 
      
      string 
      number 
      boolean 
      undefined 
      
      
      Example 
      
        typeof "John"              // Returns "string" 
        typeof 3.14                // Returns "number"
        typeof true                // Returns "boolean"
       typeof false               // Returns "boolean"
       typeof x                   // Returns "undefined" (if x has no value)
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     Complex Data 
     The typeof operator can return one of two complex types: 
      
      function 
      object 
      
     The typeof operator returns "object" for objects, arrays, and null. 
     The typeof operator does not return "object" for functions. 
      
      Example 
      
        typeof {name:'John', age:34} // Returns "object"
        typeof [1,2,3,4]             // Returns "object" (not "array", see note below)
        typeof null                  // Returns "object"
       typeof function myFunc(){}   // Returns "function"
        
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
      The typeof operator returns "object" for arrays because in JavaScript arrays are objects. 
      
      
      
      Test Yourself With Exercises 
       
       Exercise: 
       Use comments to describe the correct data type of the following variables: 
        
        
var length = 16;            // 
var lastName = "Johnson";   // 
var x = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};                          //
