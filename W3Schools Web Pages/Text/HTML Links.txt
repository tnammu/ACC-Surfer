     HTML Links 
      
      ? Previous 
      Next ? 
      
      
     Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page. 
      
     HTML Links - Hyperlinks 
     HTML links are hyperlinks. 
     You can click on a link and jump to another document. 
     When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand. 
      
      Note: A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element. 
      
      
     HTML Links - Syntax 
     Hyperlinks are defined with the HTML <a> tag: 
      
      
        <a href="
       url">
       link text</a> 
       
      
      
      Example 
      
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a> 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     The href attribute specifies the destination address (https://www.w3schools.com/html/) of the link. 
     The link text is the visible part (Visit our HTML tutorial). 
     Clicking on the link text will send you to the specified address. 
      
      Note: Without a forward slash at the end of subfolder addresses, you might generate two requests to the server. Many servers will automatically add a forward slash to the end of the address, and then create a new request. 
      
      
     Local Links 
     The example above used an absolute URL (a full web address).  
     A local link (link to the same web site) is specified with a relative URL (without https://www....). 
      
      Example 
      
        <a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a> 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     HTML Links - The target Attribute 
     The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document. 
     The target attribute can have one of the following values: 
      
      _blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab 
      _self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default) 
      _parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame 
      _top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window 
      framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame 
      
     This example will open the linked document in a new browser window/tab: 
      
      Example 
      
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a> 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     Tip: If your webpage is locked in a frame, you can use target="_top" to break out of the frame: 
      
      Example 
      
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_top">HTML5 tutorial!</a> 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     HTML Links - Image as Link 
     It is common to use images as links: 
      
      Example 
      
        <a href="default.asp">
         <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;border:0;">
       </a> 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
      Note: border:0; is added to prevent IE9 (and earlier) from displaying a border around the image (when the image is a link). 
      
      
     Link Titles 
     The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element. 
      
      Example 
      
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a>
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     External Paths 
     External pages can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page. 
     This example uses a full URL to link to a web page: 
      
      Example 
      
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
       
       Try it Yourself ? 
      
     This example links to a page located in the html folder on the current web site: 
      
      Example 
      
        <a href="/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
       
       Try it Yourself ? 
      
     This example links to a page located in the same folder as the current page: 
      
      Example 
      
        <a href="default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
       
       Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
      You can read more about file paths in the chapter HTML File Paths. 
      
      
     Chapter Summary 
      
      Use the <a> element to define a link 
      Use the href attribute to define the link address 
      Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document 
      Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
