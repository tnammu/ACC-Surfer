     C++ Variables

     C++ Variables 
     Variables are containers for storing data values.  
     In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example: 
      
      int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123 
      double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99 
      char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes 
      string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes 
      bool - stores values with two states: true or false 
      
      
     Declaring (Creating) Variables 
     To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value: 
      
      Syntax 
       
       type 
       variable = 
       value;
       
      
     Where type is one of C++ types (such as int), and variable is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable. 
     To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example: 
      
      Example 
      Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15: 
      
        int myNum = 15;
       cout << myNum;
       
      Run example ? 
      
     You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later: 
      
      Example 
      
        int myNum;
       myNum = 15;
       cout << myNum;
       
      Run example ? 
      
     Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value: 
      
      Example 
      
        int myNum = 15;  // myNum is 15
       myNum = 10;  // Now myNum is 10
       cout << myNum;  // Outputs 10
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     Constants 
     However, you can add the const keyword if you don't want others (or yourself) to override existing values (this will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only): 
      
      Example 
       
       const int myNum = 15;  // myNum will always be 15
       myNum = 10;  // error: assignment of read-only variable 'myNum'
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     Other Types 
     A demonstration of other data types: 
      
      Example 
      
        int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number without decimals)
       double myFloatNum = 5.99;    // Floating point number (with decimals)
       char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
       string myText = "Hello";     // String (text)
       bool myBoolean = true;       // Boolean (true or false)
       
      
      
      You will learn more about the individual types in the Data Types chapter. 
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     Display Variables 
     The cout object is used together with the << operator to display variables. 
     To combine both text and a variable, separate them with the << operator: 
      
      Example 
      
        int myAge = 35;
       cout << "I am " << myAge << " years old.";
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     Add Variables Together 
     To add a variable to another variable, you can use the + operator: 
      
      Example 
      
        int x = 5;
       int y = 6;
       int sum = x + y;
       cout << sum;
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     Declare Many Variables 
     To declare more than one variable of the same type, you can use a comma-separated list: 
      
      Example 
      
        int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
       cout << x + y + z;
       
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     C++ Identifiers 
     All C++ variables must be identified with unique names. 
     These unique names are called identifiers. 
     Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). 
     Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code. 
     The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are: 
      
      Names can contain letters, digits and underscores 
      Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_) 
      Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables) 
      Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc. 
      Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names
