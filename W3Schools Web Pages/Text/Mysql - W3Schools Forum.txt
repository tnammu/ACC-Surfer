                    Hi, I am running a WordPress photo contest now and then. Major problem is the low quality of pictures users are uploading. So I am looking for a simple script where a user can check a photos resolution before uploading, decoupled from the Wordpress Stuff as I'd like to use it for several occasions. I found this https://www.jqueryscript.net/form/jQuery-Plugin-To-Check-Image-Resolution-Before-Uploading-checkImageSize-js.html but I am not a coder ;o) So maybe you guys can help me to build a php file? Txs Karl
