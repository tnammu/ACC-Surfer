         <linearGradient> 
         Defines a linear gradient. Linear gradients fill the object by using a vector, and can be defined as horizontal, vertical or angular gradients. 
         id="the unique id used to reference this pattern. Required to reference it" gradientUnits="'userSpaceOnUse' or 'objectBoundingBox'. Use the view box or object to determine relative position of vector points.

         <marker> 
         Markers can be placed on the vertices of lines, polylines, polygons and paths. These elements can use the marker attributes "marker-start", "marker-mid" and "marker-end"' which inherit by default or can be set to 'none' or the URI of a defined marker. You must first define the marker before you can reference it via its URI. Any kind of shape can be put inside marker. They are drawn on top of the element they are attached to 
         markerUnits="'strokeWidth' or 'userSpaceOnUse'. If 'strokeWidth' is used then one unit equals one stroke width. Otherwise, the marker does not scale and uses the the same view units as the referencing element (default 'strokeWidth')" refx="the position where the marker connects with the vertex (default 0)" refy="the position where the marker connects with the vertex (default 0)" orient="'auto' or an angle to always show the marker at. 'auto' will compute an angle that makes the x-axis a tangent of the vertex (default 0)" markerWidth="the width of the marker (default 3)" markerHeight="the height of the marker (default 3)" viewBox="the points "seen" in this SVG drawing area. 4 values separated by white space or commas.

         <mask> 
         Masking is a combination of opacity values and clipping. Like clipping you can use shapes, text or paths to define sections of the mask. The default state of a mask is fully transparent which is the opposite of clipping plane. The graphics in a mask sets how opaque portions of the mask are 
         maskUnits="'userSpaceOnUse' or 'objectBoundingBox'. Set whether the clipping plane is relative the full view port or object (default: 'objectBoundingBox')" maskContentUnits="Use the second with percentages to make mask graphic positions relative the object. 'userSpaceOnUse' or 'objectBoundingBox' (default: 'userSpaceOnUse')" x="the clipping plane of the mask (default: -10%)"  y="the clipping plane of the mask (default: -10%)"  width="the clipping plane of the mask (default: 120%)" height="the clipping plane of the mask (default: 120%)"
