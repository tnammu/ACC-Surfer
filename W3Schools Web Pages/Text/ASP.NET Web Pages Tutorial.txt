     Easy Learning with "Run Example" 
     Our "Run Example" tool displays the ASP.NET code and the HTML output simultaneously. 
     Click on the "Run Example" button to see how it works: 
      
      Web Pages Example 
      
        <html>
        <body>
             <h1>Hello Web Pages</h1>
             <p>The time is 
       @DateTime.Now</p>

     ASP.NET Web Pages 
     Web Pages is one of many programming models for creating ASP.NET web sites and web applications. 
     Web Pages provides an easy way to combine HTML, CSS, and server code:  
      
      Easy to learn, understand, and use 
      Uses an SPA application model (Single Page Application) 
      Similar to PHP and Classic ASP 
      VB (Visual Basic) or C# (C sharp) scripting languages  
      
     In addition, Web Pages applications are easily extendable with programmable helpers for databases, videos, graphics, social networking and more.  
      
     Web Pages Tutorial 
     If you are new to ASP.NET, Web Pages is a perfect place to start.  
     In this Web Pages tutorial you will learn how to combine HTML, CSS, JavaScript and server code, using server code written in VB or C# . 
     You will also learn how to extend your web pages with programmable Web Helpers.  
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     Web Pages Examples 
     Learn by examples! 
     Because ASP.NET code is executed on the server, you cannot view the code in your browser. You will only see the output as plain HTML.  
     At W3Schools every example displays the hidden ASP.NET code. This makes it easier for you to understand how it works.
