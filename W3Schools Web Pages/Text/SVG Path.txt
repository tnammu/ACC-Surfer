     SVG Path - <path> 
     The <path> element is used to define a path. 
     The following commands are available for path data: 
      
      M = moveto 
      L = lineto 
      H = horizontal lineto 
      V = vertical lineto 
      C = curveto 
      S = smooth curveto 
      Q = quadratic B?zier curve 
      T = smooth quadratic B?zier curveto 
      A = elliptical Arc 
      Z = closepath 
      
     Note: All of the commands above can also be expressed with lower letters. Capital letters means absolutely positioned, lower cases means relatively positioned. 
      
     Example 1 
     The example below defines a path that starts at position 150,0 with a line to position 75,200 then from there, a line to 225,200 and finally closing the path back to 150,0:

     Here is the SVG code: 
      
      Example 
      
        <svg height="210" width="400">
          <path d="M150 0 L75 200 L225 200 Z" />
        </svg>

     Example 2 
     B?zier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely. Generally, the user selects two endpoints and one or two control points. A B?zier curve with one control point is called a quadratic B?zier curve and the kind with two control points is called cubic. 
     The following example creates a quadratic B?zier curve, where A and C are the start and end points, B is the control point:

     Here is the SVG code: 
      
      Example 
      
        <svg height="400" width="450">
          <path id="lineAB" d="M 100 350 l 150 -300" stroke="red"
          stroke-width="3" fill="none" />
          <path id="lineBC" d="M 250 50 l 150 300" stroke="red"
          stroke-width="3" fill="none" />
          <path d="M 175 200 l 150 0" stroke="green" stroke-width="3"
          fill="none" />
          <path d="M 100 350 q 150 -300 300 0" stroke="blue"
          stroke-width="5" fill="none" />
          <!-- Mark relevant points -->
          <g stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="black">
            <circle id="pointA" cx="100" cy="350" r="3" />
            <circle id="pointB" cx="250" cy="50" r="3" />
            <circle id="pointC" cx="400" cy="350" r="3" />
          </g>
          <!-- Label the points -->
          <g font-size="30" font-family="sans-serif" fill="black" stroke="none"
          text-anchor="middle">
            <text x="100" y="350" dx="-30">A</text>
            <text x="250" y="50" dy="-10">B</text>
            <text x="400" y="350" dx="30">C</text>
          </g>
        </svg> 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     Complex? YES!!!! Because of the complexity involved in drawing paths it is highly recommended to use an SVG editor to create complex graphics.
