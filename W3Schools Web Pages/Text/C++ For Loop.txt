     C++ For Loop 
     When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop: 
      
      Syntax 
      
        for (
       statement 1;
        statement 2;
        statement 3) {
          
       // code block to be executed
        }
        
       
      
     Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block. 
     Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block. 
     Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed. 
     The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4: 
      
      Example 
      
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
         cout << i << "\n";
       }
        
       
      Run example ? 
      
     Example explained 
     Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (int i = 0). 
     Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5). If the condition is true, the loop will start over again, if it is false, the loop will end. 
     Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed. 
      
     Another Example 
     This example will only print even values between 0 and 10: 
      
      Example 
      
        for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2) {
          cout << i << "\n";
        }
        
       
      Run example ?

        Exercise: 
        Use a for loop to print "Yes" 5 times: 
         
         
 (int i = 0; i < 5; ) {
  cout <<  << "\n";
}
