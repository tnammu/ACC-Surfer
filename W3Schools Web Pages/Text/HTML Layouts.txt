         London 
         London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants. 
         Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.

     HTML Layout Elements 
     Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or newspaper). 
     HTML offers several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page: 
      
       
        
       
      
        <header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
        <nav> - Defines a container for navigation links
        <section> - Defines a section in a document
        <article> - Defines an independent self-contained article
        <aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
        <footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
        <details> - Defines additional details
        <summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element
        
       
      
      
      
        
           
         
          
          <header> - Defines a header for a document or a section 
          <nav> - Defines a container for navigation links 
          <section> - Defines a section in a document 
          <article> - Defines an independent self-contained article 
          <aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar) 
          <footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section 
          <details> - Defines additional details 
          <summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element 
           
        
      
      
      
     HTML Layout Techniques 
     There are five different ways to create multicolumn layouts. Each way has its pros and cons: 
      
      HTML tables (not recommended) 
      CSS float property 
      CSS flexbox 
      CSS framework 
      CSS grid 
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     Which One to Choose? 
     HTML Tables 
     The <table> element was not designed to be a layout tool! The purpose of the <table> element is to display tabular data. So, do not use tables for your page layout! They will bring a mess into your code. And imagine how hard it will be to redesign your site after a couple of months. 
      
      Tip: Do NOT use tables for your page layout! 
      
      
     CSS Frameworks 
     If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap. 
      
     CSS Floats 
     It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility. Learn more about float in our CSS Float and Clear chapter.

          Paris 
          Tokyo 
          
         
         
         London 
         London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants. 
         Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.

     CSS Flexbox 
     Flexbox is a new layout mode in CSS3. 
     Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. Disadvantages: Does not work in IE10 and earlier.  
     Learn more about flexbox in our CSS Flexbox chapter.

          Paris 
          Tokyo 
          
         
         
         London

         Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.

     CSS Grid View 
     The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. 
     Disadvantages: Does not work in IE nor in Edge 15 and earlier.  
     Learn more about CSS grids in our CSS Grid View chapter.
