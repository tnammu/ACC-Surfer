     Java Inheritance (Subclass and Superclass) 
     In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories: 
      
      subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class 
      superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from 
      
     To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword. 
     In the example below, the Car class (subclass) inherits the attributes and methods from the Vehicle class (superclass): 
      
      Example 
      class Vehicle {
  protected String brand = "Ford";        // Vehicle attribute
  public void honk() {                    // Vehicle method
    System.out.println("Tuut, tuut!");
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  private String modelName = "Mustang";    // Car attribute
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Create a myCar object
    Car myCar = new Car();

    // Call the honk() method (from the Vehicle class) on the myCar object
    myCar.honk();

    // Display the value of the brand attribute (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class
    System.out.println(myCar.brand + " " + myCar.modelName);
  }
}
 
       Run example ?  
      
      
      Did you notice the protected modifier in Vehicle? 
      We set the brand attribute in Vehicle to a protected access modifier. If it was set to private, the Car class would not be able to access it. 
      Why And When To Use "Inheritance"? 
      - It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class. 
      Tip: Also take a look at the next chapter, Polymorphism, which uses inherited methods to perform different tasks. 
      
      
     The final Keyword 
     If you don't want other classes to inherit from a class, use the final keyword: 
      
      If you try to access a final class, Java will generate an error: 
      final class Vehicle {
  ...
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  ...
}
 
      The output will be something like this: 
       
        Car.java:8: error: cannot inherit from final Vehicleclass Car extends Vehicle {                   ^ 1 error)
