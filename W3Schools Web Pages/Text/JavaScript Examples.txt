      JavaScript will NOT convert strings to numbers when adding 
      A number divided by a string is NaN (Not a Number) 
      A number divided by a numeric string is a number 
      The global JavaScript function isNaN() returns if a value is a number 
      Using NaN in a mathematical operation will always return NaN 
      Using NaN in a mathematical string operation will concatenate NaN 
      NaN (Not a Number) is a number (Yes! typeof NaN returns number) 
      Infinity is returned if you calculate a number outside the largest possible number 
      Division by zero also generates Infinity 
      Infinity is a number (typeof Infinity returns number) 
      Constants, preceded by 0x, are interpreted as hexadecimal 
      The toString() method can output numbers as hex, octal, and binary 
      Numbers can be objects 
      Numbers and objects cannot be safely compared 
      Objects and objects cannot be safely compared 
      
     Numbers Explained 
      
     JavaScript Number Methods 
      
      The toString() method converts a number to a string 
      The valueOf() method returns a number as a number 
      The toExponential() returns a number with exponential notation 
      The toFixed() method rounds a number to a number of digits 
      The toPrecision() method a number written with a specified length 
      The global method Number() converts variables to numbers 
      The global method Number() can even convert dates to numbers 
      The global method parseInt() converts strings to numbers 
      The global method parseFloat() converts strings to numbers 
      MAX_VALUE returns the largest possible number in JavaScript 
      MIN_VALUE returns the smallest possible number in JavaScript 
      POSITIVE_INFINITY represents infinity 
      POSITIVE_INFINITY is returned on overflow 
      NEGATIVE_INFINITY represents negative infinity 
      NEGATIVE_INFINITY is returned on overflow 
      NaN Represents "Not-a-Number" 
      Arithmetic performed on a string will result in NaN 
      Using a Number property on a variable will return undefined
