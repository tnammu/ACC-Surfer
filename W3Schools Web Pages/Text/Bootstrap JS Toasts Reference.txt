     Toast CSS Classes 
     The Toast component is like an alert box that is only shown for a couple of seconds when something happens (i.e. when the user clicks on a button, submits a form, etc.). 
     For a tutorial about Toasts, read our Bootstrap Toast Tutorial.

        Description 
        Example 
        
        
        .toast 
        Creates the toast 
        Try it 
        
        
        .toast-header 
        Creates the toast header 
        Try it 
        
        
        .toast-body 
        Creates the toast body 
        Try it 
        
      
      
      
     Activate Via JavaScript 
     Toasts must be initialized with jQuery: select the specified element and call the toast() method. 
      
      Example 
      
        <script>
       $(document).ready(function(){
         $('.toast').toast('show');
       });
