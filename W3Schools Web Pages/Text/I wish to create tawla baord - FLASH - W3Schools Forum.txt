               Why Flash?  Native support for HTML 5 is widespread enough, and Flash is blocked on enough devices, that using Flash these days doesn't make much sense.

               Have you gone through the Javascript tutorials?  You'll need to use a lot of Javascript to build a game.  Also probably a canvas.
