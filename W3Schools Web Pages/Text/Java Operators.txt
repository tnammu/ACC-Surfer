     Java Operators

     Java Operators 
     Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. 
     In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values: 
      
      Example 
      int x = 100 + 50;
 
       Run example ?  
      
     Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable: 
      
      Example 
      int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)
 
       Run example ?  
      
     Java divides the operators into the following groups: 
      
      Arithmetic operators 
      Assignment operators 
      Comparison operators 
      Logical operators 
      Bitwise operators 
      
      
     Arithmetic Operators 
     Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

         x / y 
         Try it ? 
         
         
         % 
         Modulus 
         Returns the division remainder 
         x % y 
         Try it ? 
         
         
         ++ 
         Increment 
         Increases the value of a variable by 1 
         ++x 
         Try it ? 
         
         
         -- 
         Decrement 
         Decreases the value of a variable by 1 
         --x

     Java Assignment Operators 
     Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. 
     In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x: 
      
      Example 
      int x = 10;
 
       Try it Yourself ?  
      
     The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable: 
      
      Example 
      int x = 10;
x += 5;

        += 
        x += 3 
        x = x + 3 
        Try it ? 
        
        
        -= 
        x -= 3 
        x = x - 3 
        Try it ? 
        
        
        *= 
        x *= 3 
        x = x * 3 
        Try it ? 
        
        
        /= 
        x /= 3 
        x = x / 3 
        Try it ? 
        
        
        %= 
        x %= 3 
        x = x % 3 
        Try it ? 
        
        
        &= 
        x &= 3 
        x = x & 3 
        Try it ? 
        
        
        |=
