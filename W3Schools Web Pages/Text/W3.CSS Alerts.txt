     Closing Alerts 
     To close the alert box, click on the X in the upper right corner: 
      
      ? 
      Danger! 
      Red often indicates a dangerous or negative situation. 
      
     To create the X that closes the alert, add a <span> element with class w3-button and an onclick event: 
      
      Example 
      
        <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'"
       class="w3-button w3-display-topright">&times;</span> 
       
      Try It Yourself ? 
      
      
      Tip: The HTML &times; entity is the preferred icon for close buttons (rather than the letter "X").

     Use the w3-round classes if you want rounded corners: 
      
      Success! 
      Here w3-round is used. 
      
      
      Success! 
      Here w3-round-large is used.

      Try It Yourself ? 
      
      
     Alert as a Card 
     Use a w3-card class if you want the alert to be displayed as a card: 
      
      Warning! 
      Yellow often indicates something that needs attention. 
      
      
      Example 
      
        <div class="w3-panel w3-yellow w3-card-4">
