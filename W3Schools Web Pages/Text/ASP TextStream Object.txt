     The TextStream Object 
     The TextStream object is used to access the contents of text files. 
     The following code creates a text file (c:\test.txt) and then writes some text to the file (the variable f is an instance of the TextStream object): 
     
      
        <%
        dim fs,f
        set fs=Server.CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
        set f=fs.CreateTextFile("c:\test.txt",true)
        f.WriteLine("Hello World!")
        f.Close
        set f=nothing
        set fs=nothing
        %>
      
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     To create an instance of the TextStream object you can use the CreateTextFile or OpenTextFile methods of the FileSystemObject object, or you can use the OpenAsTextStream method of the File object.
