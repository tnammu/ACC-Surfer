     C++ Comments 
     Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code. Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined. 
     Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//). 
     Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed). 
     This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code: 
      
      Example 
      
        // This is a comment
       cout << "Hello World!";
       
      Run example ? 
      
     This example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code: 
      
      Example 
      
        cout << "Hello World!"; // This is a comment
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     C++ Multi-line Comments 
     Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */. 
     Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler: 
      
      Example 
      
        /* The code below will print the words Hello World!
       to the screen, and it is amazing */
       cout << "Hello World!";
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
      Single or multi-line comments? 
      It is up to you which you want to use. Normally, we use // for short comments, and /* */ for longer.
