     Python File Open 
      
      ? Previous

     Open a File on the Server 
     Assume we have the following file, located in the same folder as Python: 
      
      demofile.txt 
      
        Hello! Welcome to demofile.txt
       This file is for testing purposes.
       Good Luck!
       
      
     To open the file, use the built-in open() function. 
     The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file: 
      
      Example 
      
        f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
       print(f.read())
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     Read Only Parts of the File 
     By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return: 
      
      Example 
      Return the 5 first characters of the file: 
      
        f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
       print(f.read(
       5))
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     Read Lines 
     You can return one line by using the readline() method: 
      
      Example 
      Read one line of the file: 
      
        f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
       print(f.readline())
       
      Run example ? 
      
     By calling readline() two times, you can read the two first lines: 
      
      Example 
      Read two lines of the file: 
      
        f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
       print(f.readline())
       print(f.readline())
       
      Run example ? 
      
     By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line: 
      
      Example 
      Loop through the file line by line: 
      
        f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
       for x in f:
         print(x)
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
     Close Files 
     It is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it. 
      
      Example 
      Close the file when you are finish with it: 
      
        f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
       print(f.readline())
        f.close()
       
      Run example ? 
      
      
      Note: You should always close your files, in some cases, due to buffering, changes made to a file may not show until you close the file.
