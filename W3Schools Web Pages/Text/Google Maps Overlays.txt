     Google Maps - Overlays 
     Overlays are objects on the map that are bound to latitude/longitude coordinates. 
     Google Maps has several types of overlays: 
      
      Marker - Single locations on a map. Markers can also display custom icon images 
      Polyline - Series of straight lines on a map 
      Polygon - Series of straight lines on a map, and the shape is "closed" 
      Circle and Rectangle 
      Info Windows - Displays content within a popup balloon on top of a map 
      Custom overlays 
      
      
     Google Maps - Add a Marker 
     The Marker constructor creates a marker. Note that the position property must be set for the marker to display. 
     Add the marker to the map by using the setMap() method: 
      
      Example 
      
        var marker = new google.maps.Marker({position: myCenter});
        
        marker.setMap(map);
       
       
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     Google Maps - Animate the Marker 
     The example below shows how to animate the marker with the animation property: 
      
      Example 
      
        var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
          position:myCenter,
          animation:google.maps.Animation.BOUNCE
        });
        
        marker.setMap(map);
       
       
      
      
     Google Maps - Icon Instead of Marker 
     The example below specifies an image (icon) to use instead of the default marker: 
      
      Example 
      
        var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
          position:myCenter,
          icon:'pinkball.png'
        });
        
        marker.setMap(map);
       
       
      
      
     Google Maps - Polyline 
     A Polyline is a line that is drawn through a series of coordinates in an ordered sequence. 
     A polyline supports the following properties: 
      
      path - specifies several latitude/longitude coordinates for the line 
      strokeColor - specifies a hexadecimal color for the line (format: "#FFFFFF") 
      strokeOpacity - specifies the opacity of the line (a value between 0.0 and 1.0) 
      strokeWeight - specifies the weight of the line's stroke in pixels 
      editable - defines whether the line is editable by users (true/false) 
      
      
      Example 
      
        var myTrip = [stavanger,amsterdam,london];
        var flightPath = new google.maps.Polyline({
          path:myTrip,
          strokeColor:"#0000FF",
          strokeOpacity:0.8,
          strokeWeight:2
        });
       
       
      
      
     Google Maps - Polygon 
     A Polygon is similar to a Polyline in that it consists of a series of coordinates in an ordered sequence. However, polygons are designed to define regions within a closed loop. 
     Polygons are made of straight lines, and the shape is "closed" (all the lines connect up). 
     A polygon supports the following properties: 
      
      path - specifies several LatLng coordinates for the line (first and last coordinate are equal) 
      strokeColor - specifies a hexadecimal color for the line (format: "#FFFFFF") 
      strokeOpacity - specifies the opacity of the line (a value between 0.0 and 1.0) 
      strokeWeight - specifies the weight of the line's stroke in pixels 
      fillColor - specifies a hexadecimal color for the area within the enclosed region (format: "#FFFFFF") 
      fillOpacity - specifies the opacity of the fill color (a value between 0.0 and 1.0) 
      editable - defines whether the line is editable by users (true/false) 
      
      
      Example 
      
        var myTrip = [stavanger,amsterdam,london,stavanger];
        var flightPath = new google.maps.Polygon({
          path:myTrip,
          strokeColor:"#0000FF",
          strokeOpacity:0.8,
          strokeWeight:2,
          fillColor:"#0000FF",
          fillOpacity:0.4
        });
       
       
      
      
     Google Maps - Circle 
     A circle supports the following properties: 
      
      center - specifies the google.maps.LatLng of the center of the circle 
      radius - specifies the radius of the circle, in meters 
      strokeColor - specifies a hexadecimal color for the line around the circle (format: "#FFFFFF") 
      strokeOpacity - specifies the opacity of the stroke color (a value between 0.0 and 1.0) 
      strokeWeight - specifies the weight of the line's stroke in pixels 
      fillColor - specifies a hexadecimal color for the area within the circle (format: "#FFFFFF") 
      fillOpacity - specifies the opacity of the fill color (a value between 0.0 and 1.0) 
      editable - defines whether the circle is editable by users (true/false) 
      
      
      Example 
      
        var myCity = new google.maps.Circle({
          center:amsterdam,
          radius:20000,
          strokeColor:"#0000FF",
          strokeOpacity:0.8,
          strokeWeight:2,
          fillColor:"#0000FF",
          fillOpacity:0.4
        });
       
       
      
      
     Google Maps - InfoWindow 
     Show an InfoWindow with some text content for a marker: 
      
      Example 
      
        var infowindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow({
          content:"Hello World!"
        });
        
        infowindow.open(map,marker);
