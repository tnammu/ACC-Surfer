     Bootstrap Grid System 
     Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page. 
     If you do not want to use all 12 column individually, you can group the columns together to create wider columns: 
      
       
       
         
         span 1 
         span 1 
         span 1 
         span 1 
         span 1 
         span 1 
         span 1 
         span 1 
         span 1 
         span 1 
         span 1 
         span 1 
         
         
          span 4 
          span 4 
          span 4 
         
         
         span 4 
         span 8 
         
         
         span 6 
         span 6 
         
         
         span 12 
         
       
       
     
     Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange depending on the screen size: On a big screen it might look better with the content organized in three columns, but on a small screen it would be better if the content items were stacked on top of each other. 
      
      Tip: Remember that grid columns should add up to twelve for a row. More than that, columns will stack no matter the viewport. 
      
      
     Grid Classes 
     The Bootstrap grid system has four classes: 
      
      xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide) 
      sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide) 
      md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide) 
      lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide) 
      
     The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts. 
     Tip: Each class scales up, so if you wish to set the same widths for xs and sm, you only need to specify xs.  
      
     Grid System Rules 
     Some Bootstrap grid system rules: 
      
      Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding 
      Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns 
      Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows 
      Predefined classes like .row and .col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts 
      Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows 
      Grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-sm-4 
      Column widths are in percentage, so they are always fluid and sized relative to their parent element 
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     Basic Structure of a Bootstrap Grid 
     The following is a basic structure of a Bootstrap grid: 
      
      
        <div class="container">
         <div class="row">
           <div class="col-*-*"></div>
           <div class="col-*-*"></div>
         </div>
         <div class="row">
           <div class="col-*-*"></div>
           <div class="col-*-*"></div>
           <div class="col-*-*"></div>
         </div>
         <div class="row">
           ...
         </div>
       </div>
       
      
     So, to create the layout you want, create a container (<div class="container">). Next, create a row (<div class="row">). Then, add the desired number of columns (tags with appropriate .col-*-* classes). Note that numbers in .col-*-* should always add up to 12 for each row.  
      
      
     Grid Options
