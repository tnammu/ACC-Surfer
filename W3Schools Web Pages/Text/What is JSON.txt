        JSON
        
       
       
       JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation 
       JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data 
       JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page 
       JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand 
       
      
      
      
      JSON Example 
      This example defines an employees object: an array of 3 employee records (objects): 
      
        {
       "employees":[
            {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}, 
            {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
            {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
        ]
       }

     JSON Syntax Rules 
      
      Data is in name/value pairs 
      Data is separated by commas 
      Curly braces hold objects 
      Square brackets hold arrays 
      
      
     JavaScript Object Notation 
     The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects. 
     Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects. 
      
      The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text only. Code for reading and generating JSON data can be written in any programming language. 
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     JSON Data - A Name and a Value 
     JSON data is written as name/value pairs, just like JavaScript object properties. 
     A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value: 
     
      
        "firstName":"John"
      
      
      
      JSON names require double quotes. JavaScript names do not. 
      
      
     JSON Objects 
     JSON objects are written inside curly braces. 
     Just like in JavaScript, objects can contain multiple name/value pairs: 
     
      
        {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"} 
      
      
      
     JSON Arrays 
     JSON arrays are written inside square brackets. 
     Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain objects: 
     
      
        "employees":[
            {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}, 
            {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"}, 
            {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
        ]
      
      
     In the example above, the object "employees" is an array. It contains three objects. 
     Each object is a record of a person (with a first name and a last name). 
      
     Converting a JSON Text to a JavaScript Object 
     A common use of JSON is to read data from a web server, and display the data in a web page. 
     For simplicity, this can be demonstrated using a string as input. 
     First, create a JavaScript string containing JSON syntax: 
      
      
        var text = '{ "employees" : [' +
        '{ "firstName":"John" , "lastName":"Doe" },' +
        '{ "firstName":"Anna" , "lastName":"Smith" },' +
        '{ "firstName":"Peter" , "lastName":"Jones" } ]}';
       
      
     Then, use the JavaScript built-in function JSON.parse() to convert the string into a JavaScript object: 
      
      
        var obj = JSON.parse(text);
       
      
     Finally, use the new JavaScript object in your page: 
      
      Example 
      
        <p id="demo"></p>
        
        <script>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
        obj.employees[1].firstName + " " + obj.employees[1].lastName;
        </script>
