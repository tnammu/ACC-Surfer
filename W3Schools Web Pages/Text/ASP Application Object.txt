     ASP Application Object 
      
      ? Previous 
      Next ? 
      
      
     A group of ASP files that work together to perform some purpose is called an application. The Application object is used to tie these files together. 
      
     Application Object 
     An application on the Web may consists of several ASP files that work together to perform some purpose. The Application object is used to tie these files together. 
     The Application object is used to store and access variables from any page, just like the Session object. The difference is that ALL users share ONE Application object (with Sessions there is ONE Session object for EACH user). 
     The Application object holds information that will be used by many pages in the application (like database connection information). The information can be accessed from any page. The information can also be changed in one place, and the changes will automatically be reflected on all pages. 
     The Application object's collections, methods, and events are described below: 
     Collections 
      
      
        
        Collection 
        Description 
        
        
        Contents 
        Contains all the items appended to the application through a script command 
        
        
        StaticObjects 
        Contains all the objects appended to the application with the HTML <object> tag 
        
      
      
     Methods 
      
      
        
        Method 
        Description 
        
        
        Contents.Remove 
        Deletes an item from the Contents collection 
        
        
        Contents.RemoveAll() 
        Deletes all items from the Contents collection 
        
        
        Lock 
        Prevents other users from modifying the variables in the Application object 
        
        
        Unlock 
        Enables other users to modify the variables in the Application object (after it has been locked using the Lock method) 
        
      
      
     Events 
      
      
        
        Event 
        Description 
        
        
        Application_OnEnd 
        Occurs when all user sessions are over, and the application ends 
        
        
        Application_OnStart 
        Occurs before the first new session is created (when the Application object is first referenced)
