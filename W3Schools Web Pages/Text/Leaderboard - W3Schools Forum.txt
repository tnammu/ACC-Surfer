                     URLs in external stylesheets are relative to the location of the stylesheet itself rather than the page. I can't tell if this is your problem or not since I don't know if your CSS is in an external stylesheet.

                     Images are inline by default. All inline elements are placed at the text baseline. There is always a bit of space reserved below the baseline, which is for hanging letters like "g" or "y", and you see this space below the image. In order to fix this, you can either make the image a block, or set its vertical align to "middle".

                   what is difference between get and post in php  
                  
                 
                 
                  
                   
                   
                     Hello @krishnanayaks Following are the differences between GET and POST Method : The GET Method : The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request. The page and the encoded information are separated by the ? character. The GET method produces a long string that appears in your server logs, in the browser's location. The GET method is restricted to send upto 1024 characters only. Never use GET method if you have password or other sensitive information to be sent to the server. GET can't be used to send binary data, like images or word documents, to the server. The data sent by GET method can be accessed using QUERY_STRING environment variable. The PHP provides $_GET associative array to access all the sent information using GET method. The POST Method : The POST method transfers information via HTTP headers. The information is encoded as described in case of GET method and put into a header called QUERY_STRING. The POST method does not have any restriction on data size to be sent. The POST method can be used to send ASCII as well as binary data. The data sent by POST method goes through HTTP header so security depends on HTTP protocol. By using Secure HTTP you can make sure that your information is secure. The PHP provides $_POST associative array to access all the sent information using POST method. I hope above information will be useful for you. Thank you.

                     These are not issues, they are just suggestions of things that the machine couldn't not verify are good. As long as a human can verify that this is accessible you can just ignore these warnings. The first message "Link text may not be meaningful." means that the text inside the link should be meaningful even out of context. This message is in place because some people put text like "click here" and "this website" which are meaningless without more context. If you think your link text is meaningful then you can ignore this message. The second message "Anchor text may not identify the link destination." is shown when none of the words of the link text are found in the URL of the link. The computer thinks that this might indicate that the link text does not describe the page that you are linking to, however if you know for sure that the link text describes the target page then you can just ignore this message as well.

                   Save changes after reloading the page with local storage  
                  
                 
                 
                  
                   
                   
                     The first line always reset it on every reload, you only need that to happen when it has not already been set and is empty. Also the JavaScript code needs to below any element it references as the page is rendered from top to bottom, the jS code is executed before the elements it is referencing even exist producing undefined error. You are overthinking this, all you need do is set localStorage.fontsize=1; or localstorage.fontsize=2; and so on... On click event it should increment a variable on each click then reset if greater than 3 the use if conditions n++; if(n > 3){ n=1; } localStorage.fontsize=n; if (localStorage?????.fontsize==1){ document.getElementById?????("a").sty?le.fon?tSiz?e ?= ?"20p?x"; } // and so on... On load you should see if fontsize exists else set to defalut if (localStorage.fontsize) { if (localStorage?????.fontsize==1){ document.getElementById?????("a").sty?le.fon?tSiz?e ?= ?"20p?x"; } // and so on... else { localstorage.fontsize=1; }

                   How to save this in local storage ?  
                  
                 
                 
                  
                   
                   
                     Localstorage will do that. First you set a default value if localstorage does not currently store any value related to chosen font size, else load localstorage value and make the chosen font-size active on page load or refresh. Then set onclick event to make selected fontsize active then at same set localstorage to store currently selected font-size also.
