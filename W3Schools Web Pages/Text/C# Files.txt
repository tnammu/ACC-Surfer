     Working With Files 
     The File class from the  System.IO namespace, allows us to work with files: 
      
      Example 
      using System.IO;  // include the System.IO namespace

File.SomeFileMethod();  // use the file class with methods
 
      
     The File class has many useful methods for creating and getting information about files. For example: 
      
       
        
         
         Method 
         Description 
         
         
         AppendText() 
         Appends text at the end of an existing file 
         
         
         Copy() 
         Copies a file 
         
         
         Create() 
         Creates or overwrites a file 
         
         
         Delete() 
         Deletes a file 
         
         
         Exists() 
         Tests whether the file exists 
         
         
         ReadAllText() 
         Reads the contents of a file 
         
         
         Replace() 
         Replaces the contents of a file with the contents of another file 
         
         
         WriteAllText() 
         Creates a new file and writes the contents to it. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. 
         
        
       
      
      
      For a full list of File methods, go to Microsoft .Net File Class Reference. 
      
      
     Write To a File and Read It 
     In the following example, we use the WriteAllText() method to create a file named "filename.txt" and write some content to it. Then we use the ReadAllText() method to read the contents of the file: 
      
      Example 
      using System.IO;  // include the System.IO namespace

string writeText = "Hello World!";  // Create a text string
File.WriteAllText("filename.txt", writeText);  // Create a file and write the content of writeText to it

string readText = File.ReadAllText("filename.txt");  // Read the contents of the file
Console.WriteLine(readText);  // Output the content
 
      The output will be: 
       
        Hello World!
