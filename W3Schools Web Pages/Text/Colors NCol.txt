     Natural Colors (NCol) 
     Natural colors (NCol) is an initiative from W3Schools. 
     The system is designed to make it easier to select HTML colors. 
     NCol specifies colors using a color letter with a number to specify the distance (in percent) from the color. 
     R30 means 30% away from Red , moving towards Yellow. (In other words: Red with 30% Yellow)

     Color and distance can also be given in hues (0-360): 
      
      
        
        R = 000 
        Y = 060 
        G = 120 
        C = 180 
        B = 240 
        M = 300 
        
      
      
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     HTML Support 
     NCol is not supported in HTML, but it is very close to the new HWB color system suggested in CSS4. 
     While waiting for CSS4, you can include W3Schools' Color library, and use NCol as an HTML attribute like this: 
      
      Example 
      
        <div data-w3-color="R50,50%,0">
       
        <p>London is the capital city of England.
        It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom,
        with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
       
        </div> 
       
       <script src="/lib/w3color.js"></script>

     W3Schools Color Library 
     The JavaScript library used in the example above can be downloaded from 
     https://www.w3schools.com/lib/w3color.js 
      
     Why NCol? 
     Trying to explain colors using RGB or HEX notation is very difficult. 
     Can you tell what color rgb(199,21,133) is? 
     RGB is based on how to physically produce colors by mixing light sources. 
     NCol is based on what colors look like to the human eye.   
     Because of this, NCol makes it much easier to describe colors.  
     Natural colors were first described by Karl Ewald Konstantin Hering (Germany 1834 - 1918).
