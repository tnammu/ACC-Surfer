     JavaScript For Loop

     Loops can execute a block of code a number of times. 
      
     JavaScript Loops 
     Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value. 
     Often this is the case when working with arrays: 
      
      Instead of writing: 
      
        text += cars[0] + "<br>"; 
       text += cars[1] + "<br>"; 
        text += cars[2] + "<br>"; 
       text += cars[3] + "<br>"; 
        text += cars[4] + "<br>"; 
       text += cars[5] + "<br>"; 
       
      You can write: 
      
        var i;
       for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) { 
         text += cars[i] + "<br>";
        }

     Different Kinds of Loops 
     JavaScript supports different kinds of loops: 
      
      for - loops through a block of code a number of times 
      for/in - loops through the properties of an object 
      for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object  
      while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true 
      do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true 
      
      
     The For Loop 
     The for loop has the following syntax: 
     
      
        for (
       statement 1;
        statement 2;
        statement 3) {
          // 
       code block to be executed
        }
        
      
      
     Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block. 
     Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block. 
     Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed. 
      
      Example 
      
        for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
          text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
        }
        
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     From the example above, you can read: 
     Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0). 
     Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5). 
     Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed. 
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
     Statement 1 
     Normally you will use statement 1 to initialize the variable used in the loop (i = 0). 
     This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 1 is optional. 
     You can initiate many values in statement 1 (separated by comma): 
      
      Example 
      
        for (i = 0, len = cars.length, text = ""; i < len; i++) { 
         text += cars[i] + "<br>";
        }
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     And you can omit statement 1 (like when your values are set before the loop starts): 
      
      Example 
      
        var i = 2;
       var len = cars.length;
       var text = "";
       for (; i < len; i++) { 
          text += cars[i] + "<br>";
        }
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     Statement 2 
     Often statement 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial variable. 
     This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 2 is also optional. 
     If statement 2 returns true, the loop will start over again, if it returns false, the loop will end. 
      
      If you omit statement 2, you must provide a break inside the loop. Otherwise the loop will never end. This will crash your browser. Read about breaks in a later chapter of this tutorial. 
      
      
     Statement 3 
     Often statement 3 increments the value of the initial variable. 
     This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care, and statement 3 is optional. 
     Statement 3 can do anything like negative increment (i--), positive increment (i = i + 15), or anything else. 
     Statement 3 can also be omitted (like when you increment your values inside the loop):  
      
      Example 
      
        var i = 0;
       var len = cars.length;
       for (; i < len; ) { 
         text += cars[i] + "<br>";
          i++;
       }
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     The For/In Loop 
     The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an object: 
      
      Example 
      
        var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25}; 
        
        var text = "";
       var x;
       for (x in person) {
          text += person[x];
        }
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     The For/Of Loop 
     The JavaScript for/of statement loops through the values of an iterable objects 
      for/of lets you loop over data structures that are iterable such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more. 
     The for/of loop has the following syntax: 
     
      
        for (
       variable of 
       iterable) {
          // 
       code block to be executed
        }
        
      
      
     variable - For every iteration the value of the next property is assigned to the variable. Variable can be declared with const, let, or var. 
     iterable - An object that has iterable properties. 
     Looping over an Array 
      
      Example 
      
        var cars = ['BMW', 'Volvo', 'Mini'];
       var x;
       
       for (x of cars) {
          document.write(x + "<br >");
       }
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     Looping over a String 
      
      Example 
      
        var txt = 'JavaScript';
       var x;
       
       for (x of txt) {
         document.write(x + "<br >");
       }
