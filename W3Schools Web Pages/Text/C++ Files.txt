     C++ Files 
     The fstream library allows us to work with files. 
     To use the fstream library, include both the standard <iostream> AND the <fstream> header file: 
      
      Example 
      
        #include <iostream>
       #include <fstream>
       
      
     There are three objects included in the fstream library, which are used to create, write or read files: 
      
       
        
         
         Object/Data Type 
         Description 
         
         
         ofstream 
         Creates and writes to files 
         
         
         ifstream 
         Reads from files 
         
         
         fstream 
         A combination of ofstream and ifstream: creates, reads, and writes to files 
         
        
       
      
      
     Create and Write To a File 
     To create a file, use either the ofstream or fstream object, and specify the name of the file. 
     To write to the file, use the insertion operator (<<). 
      
      Example 
      
        #include <iostream>
       #include <fstream>
       using namespace std;
       
        int main() {
         // Create and open a text file
         ofstream MyFile("filename.txt");
       
         // Write to the file
         MyFile << "Files can be tricky, but it is fun enough!";
       
         // Close the file
         MyFile.close();
       }
       
      
      
      Why do we close the file? 
      It is considered good practice, and it can clean up unnecessary memory space. 
      
      
     Read a File 
     To read from a file, use either the ifstream or fstream object, and the name of the file. 
     Note that we also use a while loop together with the getline() function (which belongs to the ifstream object) to read the file line by line, and to print the content of the file: 
      
      Example 
      
        // Create a text string, which is used to output the text file
       string myText;
        
       // Read from the text file
       ifstream MyReadFile("filename.txt");
       
       // Use a while loop together with the getline() function to read the file line by line
       while (getline (MyReadFile, myText)) {
         // Output the text from the file
         cout << myText;
        }
        
       // Close the file
       MyReadFile.close();
