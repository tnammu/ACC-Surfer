     Connection Object 
     The ADO Connection Object is used to create an open connection to a data source. Through this connection, you can access and manipulate a database. 
     If you want to access a database multiple times, you should establish a connection using the Connection object. You can also make a connection to a database by passing a connection string via a Command or Recordset object. However, this type of connection is only good for one specific, single query.
