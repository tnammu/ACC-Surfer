               Hello all,  
               I will preface by saying I know only what code I find online (mainly this site) to tweak my company's pages. I am currently working on a landing page via Instapage and have a sticky header and also a pop up form. The form is being truncated by the header and would be ever so gracious if someone could help me with the code to make the form show up on top of the header as well.

               Is the header overlapping the form? You may be able to get away with checking the z-index of the header vs the form and making sure the form is higher. But without the code you're working with, it's hard to say.
