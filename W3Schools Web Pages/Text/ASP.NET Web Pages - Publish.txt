     ASP.NET Web Pages - Publishing the Website 
      
      ? Previous 
      Next ? 
      
      
      1. Use the Latest Version of ASP.NET 
     Before you continue, make sure your hosting computer runs the latest version of ASP.NET (4.0 or 4.5). 
      
      2. Copy the Web Folders 
     Copy your website (all folders and content) from your development computer to an application folder on your remote hosting computer (server). 
      
      If your application contains data, don't copy the data (see point 4 below). 
      
      
      3. The DLL Files 
     Make sure the bin folder, on your remote hosting computer, contains the same dll files as on your development computer. 
     After copying the bin folder, it should contain files like this: 
     Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure.dll NuGet.Core.dll System.Web.Helpers.dll System.Web.Razor.dll System.Web.WebPages.Administration.dll System.Web.WebPages.Deployment.dll System.Web.WebPages.dll System.Web.WebPages.Razor.dll WebMatrix.Data.dll WebMatrix.WebData 
      
     4. Copy Your Data 
     If your application contains data or a database. For instance an SQL Server Compact database (a .sdf file in App_Data folder), consider the following: 
     Do you want to publish your test data to the remote server? 
     Most likely not. 
     If you have test data on your development computer, it may overwrite production data on your remote hosting computer. 
     If you have to copy an SQL database (.sdf file), perhaps you should delete everything in the database, and then copy the empty .sdf file from your development computer to the server.  
     THAT'S IT. GOOD LUCK !
