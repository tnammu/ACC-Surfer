     Prerequisites 
     Before you apply for your exam, you should have a fundamental knowledge of: 
      
      SQL 
      
      
     Recommended Studies And Training 
     All questions in the exam are based on the content of W3Schools' SQL tutorial. We strongly recommend the following tutorial and quiz: 
      
      
        
        Tutorial 
        Quiz

        SQL Quiz 
        
      
      
      
     The SQL Exam 
     The SQL exam will be taken over the Internet, at any time and from any location, but the exam should be supervised by a person selected by the exam candidate. 
     The exam consists of 70 multiple choice or true/false questions. The exam is time-limited to 70 minutes. 
     Candidates must have 75% correct answers to pass the exam and become certified. 
     Candidates who have more than 95% correct answers will get an Excellency Degree notation added to their certificate. 
     Immediately after completing the exam, you will be informed of your score and of your pass/fail status. 
     If you fail, or want to improve your score, you can take the exam one more time. The best result of the two attempts will count. 
     If you achieve certification status, you can download your SQL Developer Certificate. The document will contain your personal data acknowledging your status as a Certified SQL Developer. 
     If you have any questions regarding the exam, do not hesitate to send an email to: 
      
      
     The Supervisor 
     To add full credibility to your Certificate, you should have a supervisor to watch over you when taking the exam. 
     You must pick your own supervisor. 
     The supervisor should be used to see that you do not cheat. There are no other special criteria for the supervisor. 
     The supervisor's name and title will be printed on the certificate, so it could be wise to pick a supervisor who will add credibility to your certificate (e.g. your boss or teacher).
