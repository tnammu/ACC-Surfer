      We recommend reading this tutorial, in the sequence listed in the left menu. 
      
      
     Learn by Examples 
     Examples are better than 1000 words. Examples are often easier to understand than text explanations. 
     This tutorial supplements all explanations with clarifying "Try it Yourself" examples. 
     JavaScript Examples 
      
      If you try all the examples, you will learn a lot about JavaScript, in a very short time! 
      
      
     Why Study JavaScript? 
     JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers  must learn: 
        1. HTML to define the content of web pages 
        2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages 
        3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages  
     Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language. 
      
      
       
       
       
      
      
      
      Did You Know? 
      JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design. 
      JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.  
      You can read more about the different JavaScript versions in the chapter JS Versions. 
      
     Learning Speed 
     In this tutorial, the learning speed is your choice. 
     Everything is up to you. 
     If you are struggling, take a break, or reread the material. 
     Always make sure you understand all the "Try-it-Yourself" examples.
