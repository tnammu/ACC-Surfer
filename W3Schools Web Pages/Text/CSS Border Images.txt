      CSS Border Images 
      With the CSS border-image property, you can set an image to be used as the border around an element. 
      
      
     CSS border-image Property 
     The CSS border-image property allows you to specify an image to be used instead of the normal border around an element. 
     The property has three parts: 
      
      The image to use as the border 
      Where to slice the image 
      Define whether the middle sections should be repeated or stretched 
      
     We will use the following image (called "border.png"): 
      
     The border-image property takes the image and slices it into nine sections, like a tic-tac-toe board. It then places the corners at the corners, and the middle sections are repeated or stretched as you specify. 
     Note: For border-image to work, the element also needs the border property set! 
     Here, the middle sections of the image are repeated to create the border: 
     An image as a border! 
     Here is the code: 
      
      Example 
      
        #borderimg {
          border: 10px solid transparent;
         padding: 15px;
         border-image: url(border.png) 30 round;
       } 
       
      Try it Yourself ?

        #borderimg {
          border: 10px solid transparent;
         padding: 15px;
         border-image: url(border.png) 30 stretch;
       } 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
      Tip: The border-image property is actually a shorthand property for the border-image-source, border-image-slice, border-image-width, border-image-outset and border-image-repeat properties. 
      
      
      
       
       
        
       
      
      
     CSS border-image - Different Slice Values 
     Different slice values completely changes the look of the border: 
     Example 1: 
     border-image: url(border.png) 50 round; 
     Example 2: 
     border-image: url(border.png) 20% round; 
     Example 3: 
     border-image: url(border.png) 30% round; 
     Here is the code: 
      
      Example 
      
        #borderimg1 {
         border: 10px solid transparent;
         padding: 15px;
         border-image: url(border.png) 50 round;
       }
       
       #borderimg2 {
         border: 10px solid transparent;
         padding: 15px;
         border-image: url(border.png) 20% round;
       }
       
        #borderimg3 {
         border: 10px solid transparent;
         padding: 15px;
         border-image: url(border.png) 30% round;
       }
