     Text Colors 
     Bootstrap 4 has some contextual classes that can be used to provide "meaning through colors". 
     The classes for text colors are: .text-muted, .text-primary, .text-success, .text-info, .text-warning, .text-danger, .text-secondary, .text-white, .text-dark, .text-body (default body color/often black) and .text-light: 
      
      Example 
       
       This text is muted. 
       This text is important. 
       This text indicates success. 
       This text represents some information. 
       This text represents a warning. 
       This text represents danger. 
       Secondary text. 
       Dark grey text. 
       Body text. 
       Light grey text. 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     Contextual text classes can also be used on links, which will add a darker hover color: 
      
      Example 
       
       Muted link. 
       Primary link. 
       Success link. 
       Info link. 
       Warning link. 
       Danger link. 
       Secondary link. 
       Dark grey link. 
       Body/black link. 
       Light grey link. 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
     You can also add 50% opacity for black or white text with the .text-black-50 or .text-white-50 classes: 
      
      Example 
       
       Black text with 50% opacity on white background 
       White text with 50% opacity on black background 
       
      Try it Yourself ? 
      
      
     Background Colors 
     The classes for background colors are: .bg-primary,  .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light. 
     Note that background colors do not set the text color, so in some cases you'll want to use them together with a .text-* class. 
      
      Example 
       
       This text is important. 
       This text indicates success. 
       This text represents some information. 
       This text represents a warning. 
       This text represents danger. 
       Secondary background color. 
       Dark grey background color. 
       Light grey background color.
